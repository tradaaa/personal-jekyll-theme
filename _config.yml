author_blurb: "Maarief S. Indrawan is an random person. He likes to travel, both real and virtual world. He is what we call a nomad perhaps. Spent almost half of his live abroad (Lebanon, Russia, USA). He lives in South of Jakarta (well, Tangerang Selatan to be percise), but he works in East Jakarta. Also, during the weekend, he volunteers in Depok. In his spare time, Max (or Mak, thats what everybody called him) likes to take photograph (and watch anime)."
